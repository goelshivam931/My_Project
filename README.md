# Personnel Information System

I made this project during my internship at DRDO, using React, Node.js, Express & using MySQL as database. It is a full-stack CRUD Web Application that stores the records of employees and also help in managing & accessing them.

## Home Page

It basically shows the records of employees already stored in the database.

## Add Group Page

It basically helps in adding a new group to the database so that can be assigned to the employee while it is being added into the database.

## Now, Employees are divided on the basis of "CADRE" assigned to them while adding them into the database, into the specefic "CADRE" section from where each employee can be viewed distinctly.


## DRDS Page

It basically stores the details of all the exisiting employees whose "CADRE" is "DRDS".

## Now, for each "CADRE", each employee has been given an I-Card as well, where all his/her details are visible as a pop-up, that can be viewed by clicking the "eye-icon" next to each employee and can be closed by clicking to the "cross-icon" on top-right corner of each I-Card pop-up.
